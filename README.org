* Remote Desktop Support with P2P VNC

  VNC is a well-known tool for remote desktop view and control. The
  two computers establish a TCP connection so that one of them can
  access the display of the other. However, almost always these two
  computers are behind a firewall/router and do not have a real IP to
  be accessed from the Internet. In such a case one of them can do
  *port forwarding* on the router/firewall and this would allow the
  connection to be established.

  The problem is that more often than not, none of the parts that want
  to establish such a remote connection have access to the firewall
  that separates/protects it from the real Internet. Sometimes it can
  even be several levels deep behind the firewall (several layers of
  firewalls). However, if you have access to an external server (for
  example a server in the cloud) there is still a workaround and
  things can be fixed to work. For more details read the docs, which
  explain the tricks and hacks that can be used in such a case in
  order to establish a secure connection to a remote desktop.

  This project has some scripts that simplify the installation of a
  P2P server, and the connection between the two clients.


** Installation of a P2P server

   For more security and flexibility, the installation is done inside a
   chroot environment (which is built with debootstrap):

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   cd /var/chroot/
   git clone https://github.com/dashohoxha/p2p.git
   nohup nice p2p/server/install.sh P2P &
   tail -f nohup.out
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   After the installation is done, you can start and stop the service
   with:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   service chroot-P2P stop
   service chroot-P2P start
   #+END_EXAMPLE


** Sharing the desktop (on the client)

   To share the desktop we need a VNC server. Make sure that *x11vnc*
   is installed:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   sudo apt-get install x11vnc
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Then get the scripts from GitHub:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   git clone https://github.com/dashohoxha/p2p.git p2p-vnc
   chmod 600 p2p-vnc/client/keys/*.key
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Set the the port and the IP (or DN) of the P2P server at
   ~p2p-vnc/client/ssh.rc~:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ### the IP or DN of the p2p server
   p2p_server=127.0.0.1

   ### the port of the sshd service in the p2p server
   p2p_port=2201
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Now share the VNC port and start an *x11vnc* server.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   p2p-vnc/client/start_x11vnc.sh 

   KEY: b8e1f1e779

   Give it to the remote part in order to access your desktop.
   To stop the connection run: p2p-vnc/client/stop.sh b8e1f1e779
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   The script will return a randomly generated key which you should
   give to the other part which needs to access your desktop.

   There are more options to try. Change them at the config file
   *vnc.rc* or from the command line:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   p2p-vnc/client/start_x11vnc.sh --help

   Usage: p2p-vnc/client/start_x11vnc.sh [OPTIONS]

   Share the VNC port and start an x11vnc server.
   The options from command line override the settings
   on the config file 'vnc.rc'.

       --help             display this help screen
       --vnc_port=<port>  set the VNC port (5900)
       --window=yes       share a single window, not the whole desktop
       --viewonly=yes     the desktop cannot be controlled remotely
       --shared=yes       more than one computer can connect at the same time
       --forever=yes      keep listening for more connections (don't exit
			  when the first client(s) disconnect)
   #+END_EXAMPLE


** Accessing the remote desktop (from the other client)

   To access a remote desktop we need a VNC client. Make sure that
   *vncviewer* is installed:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   sudo apt-get install vncviewer
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Then get the Spitz from GitHub:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   git clone https://github.com/dashohoxha/p2p.git p2p-vnc
   chmod 600 p2p-vnc/client/keys/*.key
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Set the the port and the IP (or DN) of the P2P server at
   ~p2p-vnc/client/ssh.rc~:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ### the IP or DN of the p2p server
   p2p_server=127.0.0.1

   ### the port of the sshd service in the p2p server
   p2p_port=2201
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Now connect to the remote VNC port and start *vncviewer*.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   p2p-vnc/client/start_vncviewer.sh --key=b8e1f1e779
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   You will need to know the number of the key that was created by the
   remote desktop.

   See also the usage:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   p2p-vnc/client/start_vncviewer.sh --help

   Usage: p2p-vnc/client/start_vncviewer.sh [OPTIONS]

   Connect to the remote VNC port and start vncviewer.
   The options from command line override the settings
   on the config file 'vnc.rc'.

       --help             display this help screen
       --vnc_port=<port>  set the VNC port (5900)
       --key=<key>        key for connecting to the remote desktop
   #+END_EXAMPLE


** Closing a connection

   From any (or both) of the clients, the connection can be closed
   with:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   p2p-vnc/client/stop.sh b8e1f1e779
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   This will cleanup the keys on the server, close the ssh tunnels,
   and close the programs that were started locally (x11vnc,
   vncviewer, etc.)


* Other Use Cases

** Sharing a single widow

   Use the option =--window=yes= from command line (or set it on
   ~vnc.rc~) to share only a single window (not the whole
   desktop). When this option is 'yes', the mouse will become like a +
   (cross-hair) and you will be able to select a window.

** Make a demonstration to one or more people

   Start *x11vnc* with options like these:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   p2p-vnc/client/start_x11vnc.sh --viewonly=yes --shared=yes
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   The remote viewers will not be able to control your desktop (or
   window) and more than one viewers will be able to connect.

** Share the desktop permanently

   Suppose that time after time you need to access the computer at
   home remotely. Usually, after *vncviewer* is closed, *x11vnc* is
   closed automatically. But if the option =--forever=yes= is
   used, x11vnc will keep listening for more connections (after the
   first client(s) disconnect).
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   p2p-vnc/client/start_x11vnc.sh --forever=yes
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   
   *Note:* Keep in mind that a cron job on the P2P server will
   automatically delete keys older than one day. Without the key, you
   will not be able to access the desktop even if /x11vnc/ is still
   listening. If this is not what you want, try to fix this on the P2P
   server (either stop the cron or make the period longer).

** Share the Linux console (tty)

   This is very similar to sharing the desktop, but it can share the
   Linux consoles (from tty2 to tty6):
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   p2p-vnc/client/start_linuxvnc.sh --tty=3
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Share your local webserver

   Usually web developers use a local webserver for building an
   application.  What would you do to show the current prototype to
   the customer or to another developer? You can share your desktop,
   or you can share only the window of the browser. But you can also
   share your local webserver (port 80 and 443).

   It can be done like this:

   + On you side you run:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     sudo p2p-vnc/client/port_share.sh 80
     3e41a200bd
     sudo p2p-vnc/client/port_share.sh 443
     c9277c986d
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     You need *sudo* in this case because *80* and *443* are
     privileged ports and can be forwarded only by root.
 
   + On the other side, your partner should run:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     sudo p2p-vnc/client/port_connect.sh 80 3e41a200bd
     sudo p2p-vnc/client/port_connect.sh 443 c9277c986d
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     The connection keys are provided to him by you. He should make
     sure that he does not have any local webserver running on ports
     80 and 443. Now he can open =localhost= or =127.0.0.1= on his
     browser and he will directly access your local webserver.

   + To stop sharing, both of you can run:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     sudo p2p-vnc/client/port_stop.sh 3e41a200bd
     sudo p2p-vnc/client/port_stop.sh c9277c986d
     #+END_EXAMPLE

   The same way can be used for sharing other ports/services as well.
